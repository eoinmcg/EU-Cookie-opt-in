<h1>EU Cookie Law</h1>

<h2>Practical guide for website owners</h2>


<p>Cookies. A word most people associate with chocalate chips and coffee
breaks has a rather different meaning on the web. In computer jargon,
a cookie is a small piece of information that a website stores and then 
reads and modifies on your computer. Cookies cannot send viruses or install 
nasty things on your machine. They were designed for the benign purpose 
of remebering things such as logging in, your preferences or the contents. 
of your shopping cart. Depending on your surfing habits you have anywhere 
between hundreds and thousands of theses innocous little critters stored 
on your computer. This type of cookie is commonly known as a first party cookie.</p>

<p>The flip side of these small digital helpers is that they be put to work for
shadier purposes. A common tactic employed by advertisers, not to mention
Facebook's ubiquitous like button, is to to track users across all sites on 
which they appear. This allows a very comprehensive picture of your online
habits to stitched together and is a gold mine when it comes to targetted
advertising and marketing intelligence. Such cookies are referred to as third
party cookies. For many, it also represents an violation of privacy.</p>

<p>As part of the EU's Citizens Rights Directive, which comes into force on 26th
May 2012, website service provider's must gain the user's consent before
dropping cookies on their computer. Failure to do so could result in fines of up
to &pound;500,000.</p>

<h3>What is entails</h3>

<p>According to the law you must gain user's consent. The most obvious way to do
this is with a message appearing to all visitors to your site, giving them the
option to accept, and continue browsing, or reject and  leave your site. Sites
that require registration could explain how they use cookies at the sign up
stage, hence gaining permission.</p>

<h3>How does it effect me</h3>

<p>The most immediate concern is that visitors are frightened away by message
a popup asking them to accept your cookies. Most visitors probably don't know
what a cookie is. This could potentially lead to loss of business or sales.</p>

<p>If your site only uses cookies via google analytics you could always drop
analytics, but at the cost of loosing a valuable insight into website
performance. The exact kind of intelligence needed to succeed in today's
ultra competitive market place.</p>

<h3>What can I do about it</h3>

<p>Broadly speaking, a website owner has two choices;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Follow the law to the letter and notify all users that your site uses
cookies, giving them the option to accept and be tracked or to decline and
browse away from your site. Click here to see a demo of a solution we have 
implemented for our clients.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait and see how rigoursly the law will be enforced. Most websites use some
form of traffic analyisis, such as google analytics, to paint a broad
picture of website performance. As of writing this article the government's
own direct.gov.uk site does not comply with the controversial legislation.</p></li>
